Covid19 microsimulation

The following code is a Windows Console Application to run a COVID-19 Agent Based Microsimulation. It has been designed in a short time to provide insights on strategies to reduce the health consequences of the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic. 

It is provided as is. I'm aware it is not easily readble and poorly commented. I'll make improvement as I can. However, the simulation works in it's current state and has been used to run realistic simulation for France and New-York.

The current code requires Intel TBB librairies to function as it uses parralelization to improve performance.
